## Overview

The MoviePlayer frontend is a React-based application designed to provide users with a seamless media playback experience for movies and TV series. It supports video streaming with HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), episode navigation, and an interactive comment system where users can add, reply to, edit, and delete comments on specific movies or TV series episodes. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. This project focuses on the `MoviePlayer` component, which integrates video playback, episode selection (for TV series), and a comment section with nested replies.
